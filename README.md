Practice JS doing a product page 

I'm be using Js, HTML and CSS with a little of mdboostrap. The idea is to make a navbar that has a cart, 
and a product page where the customer can select how many shoes he wants to buy and also, 
he has the power to add to cart the reflect the product on the top navBar
