Practice JS doing a product page 

I'm be using Js, HTML and CSS, The idea is to make a navbar that has a Shoppingcart, 
and a product page where the customer can select how many items he wants to buy and also, 
there is a add a cart button. 

The app has some validations such as how many items we have in stuck vs how many the customes wants to buy,
there is 2 items. 

1. "to create the Shoes item call function: createShoesProduct()"
    To create the Bufanda item, call function: createBufandaProduct()""
    Note: Each of them has a product_code 
2. "Display" the item on the screen using addProductDetails(here goes to code between "here")
3. Validate when you want to increase or decrease the items number without Display any product on the screen (Point 2).
4. Validate, display an item and there is a limit of how many items for each product we have in stuck
each of them has 5.
5. When add to cart succesfull, will display a console.log for the "transation"

This is basic JS, for practice.

Thanks
